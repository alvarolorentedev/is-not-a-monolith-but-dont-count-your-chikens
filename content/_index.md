# The monolith ü§í

<img src="/images/monolith.png" width="500"/>

{{% note %}}
- There was a time we all have to work on the same code base
- You release a big thing and pray it works 
- You go through big cycles of validating the entire thing to reduce Failure rate
- You need big teams only to validate, it makes the release cycle bigger

# The microservice ü•≥

{{% note %}}
- we love the concept because it means work in smaller things
- we can break less stuff so it gives us more confidences
- we depend on less people to achieve what we want

### Can there be problems with microservice?

---

# Did you had any of this cases?
- Before we release a new version we need to sync deploys with another team.
- Our application was down but is not our issue.
- Our service was working and scaling fine until the team X started using us.
- ...

### Dam You Microlith!

<img src="/images/microliths.jpg" width="700"/>

{{% note %}}
- when you have synchronous calls to other service you are not decoupled from them
- There is even cascading possible without your knowledge
- your boundaries are not defined
- slow services are forced to scale by faster services
- additional latency

# Domains != Resources

{{% note %}}
- You are thinking in Domains being resources, this comes from the CRUD mentality
- domain driven design is about thinking on a process as a bounded context

# Independency Data != Only my data

{{% note %}}
- A single source of data means that whenever you need that data you have a direct dependency

# The Naive Solution
### circuit braked Microlith

<img src="/images/circuitbreakerdesignpattern.png" width="1000"/>

---

‚úîÔ∏è We don't fail continuously if some other service fails

‚ùå We silently don't finish the entire process requested

‚ùå We require all chain of dependencies to be called

‚ùå We force other services to scale to our needs

‚ùå Data is mutable so errors will be propagated and not solvable

# A Better Solution
### The Outbox Pattern

<img src="/images/reactivehero.jpeg" width="700"/>

## Reactive Microlith

<img src="/images/reactivemicroliths.jpg" width="700"/>

##### wait still microlith?!

{{% note %}}
- Decouple using Pub/Sub (ex. kafka, kinesis)
- Consume the models from other services you need
- Broadcast your models to others
- Strong consistency on the outbox, eventual consistency in the service DB (if you have one)

‚úîÔ∏è We don't fail continuously if some other service fails

‚úîÔ∏è We always finish our process and promise the rest will be done 

‚úîÔ∏è We just need ourselves to do what we promise

‚úîÔ∏è Fast services will be fast, and slow services can go slow

‚ùå Data is mutable so errors will be propagated and not solvable

## Microsystem (almost)

##### wait almost?!

{{% note %}}
- based on event sourcing the true is the event and not the result

‚úîÔ∏è Fast services will be fast, and slow services can go slow

‚úîÔ∏è Data is immutable so a change in our code can solve historical errors
