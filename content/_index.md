- Accelerate a great book that is extract of the state of devops report

### 4 key metrics: 2017

<img src="/images/key_metrics.png" width="550"/>

{{% note %}}
- This are metrics that have help correlate high performance teams
- They are based on trying to measure speed and stability

### 4 key metrics: Word of caution

<img src="/images/metrics_caution.png" width="335"/>

{{% note %}}
- Not a one size fit all solution.
- Useful for continuous improvement, No reporting.
- As all metrics they can be abused by management
- The solution and practices are not always the same for all teams

### You Build it you Run it

Create DevOps Culture. Not a Dev vs Ops.

<img src="/images/run_it.jpg" width="400"/>


游릭 All Metrics

{{% note %}}
- Mention Normally developers are ask for delivery speed, and operations counterpart stability.
- Devops culture is based on collaboration on running everything as a team of developers that at the same time observe operations.
- Ops need to become a tool creator for teams, and not run their operations.

### Be a Boy Scout

Don't continue the same path if you think something can be done better.

<img src="/images/scout.jpeg" width="300"/>

游릭 All Metrics

{{% note %}}
- If you see code that can be done better, or some practices that can help delivery don't shy away because you are currently not doing it
- If you don't do it nobody will

# Observability

<img src="/images/no_alarms.png" width="700"/>

--- 

### Alarms

- Get notified when something happens
- Ex. Datadog + Pager Duty

游릭 MTTR

{{% note %}}
- Alarms allow you to be lazy. you don't need to jump or spend time and brain power if its not required.
{{% /note %}}

--- 

### Metrics Dashboards

- Visualization
- Ex. Datadog

游릭 MTTR

{{% note %}}
- When something happens dashboard can gide you to where might the problem be.
- You need to learn how to read them and there are multiple types.
{{% /note %}}

### Metrics Dashboards
Details & Status

<img src="/images/dashboards.jpeg" width="1000"/>

游릭 MTTR

{{% note %}}
- It is easy to spot where the problem is in a status dashboard. 
- Root Cause is we don't enter a cognitive overload state like with the details.
{{% /note %}}

### Logs

- To go in depth in issues.
- Do not log everything.
- Ex. Kibana

游릭 MTTR

{{% note %}}
- This is the lower level you want to go. It should tell you where in the code is your issue.
- Do not log everything, just what will help you fix things. It can complicate finding what is happening if you have tons of logs.

游릭 MTTR

{{% note %}}
- This are steps in a journey.
- Continuous integration: It allows you to make sure you reproduce what you can do local somewhere else.
- Continuous Delivery: Now that you reproduce things get them somewhere that can be tested.
- Continuous Deployment: Deliver to your clients and not only to your team.
- The more mature a team is in the journey the more confident they are of going the next definition

### Everything as code

<img src="/images/infra_as_code.jpg" width="700"/>

游릭 Lead Time For Changes
游릭 MTTR

{{% note %}}
- This helps to become a devops team and not just a devs and ops segmented group.
- If you control all the parts you are building the capabilities into the solution. If not you are wrapping around things that might not fit.
- It affects both stability and speed. Your infrastructure follows your code, and vice versa.

### Blue/Green Deployment

<img src="/images/blue_green.jpeg" width="1000"/>

游릭 Change Failure Rate

{{% note %}}
- Blue green is not just a tool to minimize downtime, it can also be used as a tool to minimize failure rate.

### Canary Release 

<img src="/images/canary.jpeg" width="1000" />

游릭 Change Failure Rate

{{% note %}}
- Helps Minimize the risk of new features braking things.
- Canary releases come from miners practices. If the canary dies the human might also die.
- It gives you control at infrastructure level and is highly tide to your release capabilities.
- you can probably have issues with multiple canaries with different combination of features.

### Feature Toggles

游릭 Lead Time For Changes


{{% note %}}
- The intention is similar to canary releases. Helps Minimize the risk of new features braking things.
- It gives you control at code level. 
- 2 types: release (on/off), context (Higher level of granularity user Ids, location, disk space...)
- Allows you to disconnect from the release cycle. So you can react faster.
- Enables other capabilities like A/B testing, and testing in prod.

### Environments

{{% note %}}
- Adds 'safeguards' and places to test that are different than the users environment.
- They are difficult to maintain and align between different teams, it can lead to strange behavior.
- Difficult to validate the end result.
- They have a dollar cost attached.
- Normally to solve an issue you need to go through all the environments, affecting the time to get solutions out.
{{% /note %}}

### Single Environment

<img src="/images/single_environment.jpeg" width="500" />

游릭 MTTR

{{% note %}}
- It allows you to control what data is for test.
- A single environment ensures continues alignment.
- Smaller $ cost.
- You get the real performance & behavior.
- Achieve this is to have a flag across your system

### Pyramid

<img src="/images/pyramid.jpeg" width="700" />

游릭 Change Failure Rate

{{% note %}}
- Probably the most important of all.
- Tests are not just manual or unit. There are tons of things that need to be validated.
- All validations should be reproducible.
- This is the main thing that brings stability as it brings quality into the codebase
{{% /note %}}

### Git Flow & Trunk Base

<img src="/images/trunk.png" width="700" />

游릭 Deployment Frequency

{{% note %}}
- Long lived branches are difficult to merge.
- When you merge sometimes you need to revalidate all the work.
- On only branch force you to think about small units. 
- You get the entire picture of your code all the time.
- There are minimal merge conflicts.
- I am not doing toggles can I do trunk based development. There are other ways like abstractions that are not connected that achieve the same goal.
{{% /note %}}

### Versionless: Expand & Contract

<img src="/images/expand_contract.jpeg" width="700" />

游릭 Lead Time for Changes


{{% note %}}
- Software evolves continuously, so things will get deprecated and be replaced all the time.
- Versions allow you to separate changes. But the more versions the more complex the maintenance and more costly.
- Expand an contract allows you to do parallel changes. 
- keep compatibility till nobody uses it.
